# Personal Links :chains:

I made this whole project using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Styled Components</strong>

I just made this project earlier, using HTML/CSS. So I decided to recreate it using React. So here it is! :fire:

# How to run this project?

In your terminal, type:

`
git clone https://github.com/gabrielcaamargo/personalLinks.git
`

Then, open the project's folder using:

`
  cd personalLinks
`

Then you <strong>got it! :fire:</strong> 

Now start a local server using:

`
yarn dev
`

And finally, in your browser, open:

`
http://localhost:3000/
`
